This is the code for the tutorial hosted at [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-crud-application-with-flask-and-sqlalchemy-dm3wv7yu2).


## Initializing the Database

Before running the application, initialize the database by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/initdb
```

This will create the necessary tables in the database.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the application, use the following command:

```
pytest test_bookmanager.py
```

This will execute the tests and provide a report of the results.
